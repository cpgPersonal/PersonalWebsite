                    <p>Hi, my name is Callum and I am currently a student in the University of Reading. I am studying BSc Computer science and am really enjoying it. I grew up in Cornwall studying for GCSE's, and studying for a BTEC Level 3 diploma in IT. I achieved Distinction* Distinction Distinction for this.</p>
                    <p>Other than computer science, I have also previously loved doing photography. I had a Canon EOS 550D DSLR camera. I also had a DJI mini 2 SE and a GoPro hero 8. These were for personal use to take pictures of the sunset down the beach for example.</p>

                    <p>A teacher in my old school once said that if I signed up to do GCSE computer science, I wouldnt be able to do it as its too hard. I am now in the University of Reading. I am very happy with the effort I made and the outcome this gave me.</p>
