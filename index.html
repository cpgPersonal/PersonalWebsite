                    <p>Hi, my name is Callum and I am currently a student in the University of Reading. I am studying BSc Computer science and am really enjoying it. I grew up in Cornwall studying for GCSE's, and studying for a BTEC Level 3 diploma in IT. I achieved Distinction* Distinction Distinction for this.</p>
                    <p>Other than computer science, I have also previously loved doing photography. I had a Canon EOS 550D DSLR camera. I also had a DJI mini 2 SE and a GoPro hero 8. These were for personal use to take pictures of the sunset down the beach for example.</p>

        <!-- Why I chose the University of Reading -->
        <section id="readingUni" class="whyUniBg">
            <p class="whyUniTitle">Why did I choose the University of Reading?</p>
            <div class="whyUniTextBg">
                <p style="padding: 1%;">Now the question is, why did I choose the University of Reading? I'll start from the beginning. I was at college not originally thinking I wanted to go to university. This is the reason I chose to do a BTEC instead of A levels. But after the first year of college doing IT, I changed my mind of going to university.</p>
                <p style="padding: 1%">Anyways, after realising I did want to go to university, whilst still doing my IT diploma, I tried to get some help with which university to choose and looked online for different ones available and found some. I hadn’t even heard of the University of Reading at that point. I then went up to Cardiff University, but unfortunately I wasn’t sure if that place was for me.</p>
                <p style="padding: 1%">One day, my mum said to me about the University of Reading, and there was an open day. I looked online at this University and saw about the Computer Science Degree they had available and then saw the open day coming up. I went to this and as soon as I arrived in the university, I knew this place was for me. All of the people showing us around were so nice and supportive, and having an introduction to the course proved to me that the degree I looked into was the degree for me.</p>
                <p style="padding: 1%">But that wasn’t it, the green environment around the university itself was another thing I loved. Based on I’m from a beach town in Cornwall and love doing photography, green areas are something I love.</p>
                <p style="padding: 1%">I started this degree and as I am writing this, I am currently halfway through the second year of university. I have found Computer Science not an easy subject to do, but am pushing my way through, and getting good grades.</p>
